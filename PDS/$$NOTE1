Sam,

Attached to this email is a file named 'cbtknuth.zip' and its
size is 374KB or 382,692 bytes.  When you unzip it you should get
file 'cbtknuth.xmi'.  The first file, $$ASMDOC contains the
documentation.  The other files are named ASM00001 to ASM00062.
Except for a few data files, these are assembler language
programs of selected algorithms from Donald Knuth's books. ( The
Art of Computer Programming, Volume 1 Fundamental Algorithms and
Volume 3 Sorting and Searching) They consist mainly of
coroutines, sorts, and searches.  ASM00049 is a table that
summarizes the various sort timimgs and ASM00062 is a table that
summarizes the search timings.


Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions.  Thanks.
