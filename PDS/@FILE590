//***FILE 590 is from Charles Hottel and contains some interesting  *   FILE 590
//*           programs in Assembler Language that were created in   *   FILE 590
//*           order to do some of the programming exercises in      *   FILE 590
//*           Donald Knuth's first and third books:  Fundamental    *   FILE 590
//*           Algorithms, and Sorting and Searching.  As any reader *   FILE 590
//*           of Knuth's books knows, Knuth's programming examples  *   FILE 590
//*           are in a special language he made up, called MIX.     *   FILE 590
//*           These programming illustrations have been done in     *   FILE 590
//*           BAL Assembler Language, so they will run on S/390     *   FILE 590
//*           computers under MVS.                                  *   FILE 590

//*           These programs, besides being useful in their own     *   FILE 590
//*           right, will make it easier for an Assembler Language  *   FILE 590
//*           oriented person to understand and make practical,     *   FILE 590
//*           the principles that Knuth is trying to teach us.      *   FILE 590
